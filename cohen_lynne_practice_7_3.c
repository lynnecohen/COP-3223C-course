Please perform below 4 steps to solve the task:
1. Read the problem statement.
2. Formulate the algorithm using pseudocode and top-down, stepwise refinement.
3. Write a C program.
4. Test, debug and execute the C program

Task: Using the techniques from section 7.12.2 create a menu-driven program. 
Allow the user to choose whether to calculate a circle’s circumference, 
a circle’s area or a sphere’s volume. 
The program should then input a radius from the user, 
perform the appropriate calculation and display the result. 

Use an array of function pointers in which each pointer represents a function 
that returns void and receives a double parameter. 
The corresponding functions should each display messages 
indicating which calculation was performed, 
the value of the radius and the result of the calculation.
