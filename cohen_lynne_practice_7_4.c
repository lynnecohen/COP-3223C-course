Please perform below 4 steps to solve the task:
1. Read the problem statement.
2. Formulate the algorithm using pseudocode and top-down, stepwise refinement.
3. Write a C program.
4. Test, debug and execute the C program

Task: Please write a program which do following:

1) Allow user keep entering numbers until user enter -1, which indicates user entered all numbers
2) Store the numbers in a dynamic array.
3) Initialize the dynamic array size to 4
4) Display all the elements 
5) Ask user to enter a number and search if that number is in the array. 
6) Create a function called expandSize which double the size of the array when the its size reaches the limit
7) Create a function called displayArray which print out all the elements in the array
8) Create a function called search, which search is a given number is inside the array. Return the index of that number if it is in the array, return -1 if the number not found in the array. 
9) All functions include at least one parameter which receive the dynamic array by reference
